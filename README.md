🌍 Climate Change Dashboard – Project Summary
🧩 Overview:

The Climate Change Dashboard is a responsive web application designed to visualize and analyze climate data — specifically global temperature trends and CO₂ concentration levels over time. It offers users the ability to upload CSV data, view statistical summaries, interact with dynamic charts, preview raw data in table form, and even check the current weather in Bengaluru using real-time API integration.
🎯 Key Features:

    📁 CSV Upload and Parsing
